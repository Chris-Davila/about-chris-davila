    <p class="p1">Chris is a fun guy, and he loves to eat Mexican food! The food is best when there is plenty of <br/>
    salsa on the Tacos! What is your Go-To Hot Sauce? Mine is any sauce that makes my nose runny and makes my <br/>
    tongue burn with a savory heat! I am the kind of guy who will put salsa on salsa and enjoy the feast!</p>

    <p class="p1">This here is some of my favorite kind of Tacos. Carne Asada Tacos!! I like all kinds of Tacos, and there <br/>
    needs to be more Taco places with a Taco Buffet. A mexican restaurant has to have a salsa bar with various <br/>
    salsas or it is not an official mexican restaurant. There should also be some mexican music playing on the <br/>
    loud speakers! Ay Ay Aye!</p>
